      description: When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the
        best first step. If that doesn???t work, you can submit evidence in order
        to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your dashboard,
        but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.Depending
        on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance
        of winning your dispute. You may want to consult our guide to dispute types
        to help you figure out which evidence fields to provide.
